##JHU DS Capstone -Yelp project

Submission for Capstone course in JHU Data Science / Coursera program.

Two docs submitted for final report: Lewis-Capstone-Final.Rmd and Lewis-Capstone-Final.Rpres. 

From report: 
In 2015, Yelp released a series of data sets as part of the Yelp Dataset Challenge contest. These data sets included anonymized information regarding business reviews, Yelp reviewers, check-in information and tips. The objective was to make this data available to (budding) data scientists and see what can be learned about reviews and business behaviors involving of businesses reviewed on Yelp.

For this capstone project, a Shiny application was developed that allows users to work with an interactive map and see restaurants that match a users-specified selection of criteria.  In developing the interactive application, the data was analyzed, cleaned and saved in advance for quick rendering and use of the map. Details of this process along with some summary metrics are provided in this paper.
